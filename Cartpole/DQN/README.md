## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm applied to the classic "Cart Pole" problem, which is a staple challenge in the field of reinforcement learning. The objective is to develop a model that can autonomously balance a pole on a moving cart, demonstrating the capabilities of DQN in maintaining system equilibrium.

## Setup
The code is designed to run in a Python environment with essential machine learning and simulation libraries. You can execute the notebook directly in Google Colab using the badge link provided, which includes a pre-configured environment with all necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need to install the following Python packages. This setup ensures you have all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install gymnasium
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
pip install renderlab
```


## Implementing DQN Components
The DQN model in this project is structured into several critical components, each designed to handle specific aspects of the reinforcement learning process:

### Replay Memory Class
The `ReplayMemory` class is essential for the efficient training of deep reinforcement learning models. It stores the agent's experiences in a way that minimizes the correlation between consecutive learning samples, allowing for more stable and reliable learning outcomes.

```python
class ReplayMemory:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)

    def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
```

### DQN Network Class
The `DQN_Network` class defines the architecture of the neural network that learns to estimate Q-values for all possible actions given the current state. This function approximation is crucial for the agent to decide which action to take.

```python
class DQN_Network(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(DQN_Network, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)
```

### DQN Agent Class
The `DQN_Agent` class orchestrates the learning process, handling the interactions between the model predictions and the environment. It uses an epsilon-greedy policy for action selection, balancing between exploration and exploitation.

```python
class DQN_Agent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, replay_memory):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = replay_memory
        self.model = DQN_Network(state_size, action_size)
        self.epsilon = 1.0  # Starting epsilon for the epsilon-greedy policy

    def select_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.randint(0, self.action_size-1)
        else:
            return self.model(state).argmax().item()

    def train(self, batch_size):
        if len(self.memory) < batch_size:
            return
        batch = self.memory.sample(batch_size)
        # Training steps implementation goes here
```

### Model TrainTest Class
This class manages the full lifecycle of model training and testing. It sets up the environment, processes each episode, and evaluates the agent's performance over time, providing valuable insights into the model's effectiveness.

```python
class Model_TrainTest:
    def __init__(self, agent, env):
        self.agent = agent
        self.env = env

    def train(self, episodes):
        for e in range(episodes):
            state = self.env.reset()
            while True:
                action = self.agent.select_action(state)
                next_state, reward, done, _ = self.env.step(action)
                self.agent.memory.push(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
                state = next_state
                if done:
                    break
            self.agent.update_epsilon()  # Decrease epsilon
            self.agent.train(32)  # Train with a batch of experiences
```
