## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms to solve the "Cart Pole" problem, a benchmark task in reinforcement learning. Our goal is to train a model that can successfully balance a pole on a moving cart using these RL techniques.

```bash
pip install gymnasium torch matplotlib renderlab
```

### Implementing DQN Components
Detailed breakdown of each component developed for the DQN model:

#### Replay Memory Class
Manages the experience replay buffer, a crucial aspect of learning in DQNs to break correlation between successive samples.

#### DQN Network Class
Defines the neural network architecture used for approximating the Q-function, which predicts Q-values for each action given a state.

#### DQN Agent Class
Orchestrates the learning process, including decision making according to the epsilon-greedy policy, and updates to the Q-network based on sampled experiences from the memory.

### Model TrainTest Class
Handles the complete training and evaluation loop, including environment setup, episodic training, and performance assessment.

#### State Preprocessing
Transforms raw state vectors from the environment into suitable formats for the neural network.

#### Training
Details the training operations, including backpropagation, loss calculation, and network updates.

#### Testing
Evaluates the trained model on unseen episodes to test the generalization of the learned policies.

#### Visualization
Generates plots to visualize the learning progress, including rewards and loss curves over episodes.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the project, train the models, and evaluate them:

```bash
python train_test.py --train
