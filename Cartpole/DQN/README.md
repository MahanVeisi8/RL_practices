## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm applied to the classic "Cart Pole" problem, which is a staple challenge in the field of reinforcement learning. The objective is to develop a model that can autonomously balance a pole on a moving cart, demonstrating the capabilities of DQN in maintaining system equilibrium.

## Setup
The code is designed to run in a Python environment with essential machine learning and simulation libraries. You can execute the notebook directly in Google Colab using the badge link provided, which includes a pre-configured environment with all necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need to install the following Python packages. This setup ensures you have all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install gymnasium
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
pip install renderlab
```

### Implementing DQN Components
The DQN model is broken down into several key components, each responsible for a part of the learning process:

- **Replay Memory**: Handles storage and retrieval of experience tuples to reduce correlation between consecutive learning samples.
- **DQN Network**: A neural network that estimates the Q-values for each action given a particular state.
- **DQN Agent**: Manages the training cycles, decision-making processes, and updates to the network based on observations from the environment.

These components are crucial for the success of the DQN algorithm in navigating and solving the Cart Pole challenge efficiently.


#### Replay Memory Class
Manages the experience replay buffer, a crucial aspect of learning in DQNs to break correlation between successive samples.

#### DQN Network Class
Defines the neural network architecture used for approximating the Q-function, which predicts Q-values for each action given a state.

#### DQN Agent Class
Orchestrates the learning process, including decision making according to the epsilon-greedy policy, and updates to the Q-network based on sampled experiences from the memory.

### Model TrainTest Class
Handles the complete training and evaluation loop, including environment setup, episodic training, and performance assessment.

#### State Preprocessing
Transforms raw state vectors from the environment into suitable formats for the neural network.

#### Training
Details the training operations, including backpropagation, loss calculation, and network updates.

#### Testing
Evaluates the trained model on unseen episodes to test the generalization of the learned policies.

#### Visualization
Generates plots to visualize the learning progress, including rewards and loss curves over episodes.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the project, train the models, and evaluate them:

```bash
