Welcome to the **Lunar Lander D3QN** project! This repository contains the implementation of a **Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN)** for solving the Lunar Lander problem, a classic reinforcement learning task. D3QN combines both **Double Q-Learning** and **Dueling Network Architectures** to enhance performance and stability over standard DQN.

---

## **1 - Introduction**

The **Lunar Lander** environment involves controlling a spaceship to land safely on a designated pad using a main engine and two side engines. The goal is to minimize fuel consumption and avoid crashing while landing safely.

This project applies the **D3QN algorithm**, which combines **Double DQN** and **Dueling Network Architectures**, to improve learning stability and policy performance over standard DQN.

## **2 - Algorithm Overview**

### **Double DQN**

The Double DQN algorithm addresses the **overestimation bias** of Q-learning by decoupling the selection and evaluation of actions:
- The **main DQN** selects the next action \( \argmax_a Q(s', a) \).
- The **target network** computes the Q-value of the selected action.

**Double DQN Update Formula**:

This ensures that the action selection and value estimation are handled separately, reducing the tendency to overestimate action values.

### **Dueling DQN**

The **Dueling Network Architecture** decouples the state value and action advantage, improving stability by allowing the agent to estimate the **state value** \( V(s) \) and the **advantage** of each action \( A(s, a) \) independently:
- \( Q(s, a) = V(s) + A(s, a) - \frac{1}{|A|}\sum A(s, a') \)

This architecture enables the network to distinguish between the importance of the state and the action more effectively, improving learning.

## **3 - D3QN Implementation**

### **Replay Memory**

The `ReplayMemory` class stores the agentâ€™s experiences, which are then sampled in mini-batches for learning. This helps reduce correlation between sequential experiences, improving learning efficiency.

### **Dueling DQN Network**

The `DuelingDQN_network` class implements the dueling architecture, which separates the estimation of the state value and the action advantage:
- **Shared Network**: Extracts features common to both the value and advantage.
- **Value Stream**: Estimates the value of the current state \( V(s) \).
- **Advantage Stream**: Estimates the advantage of each action \( A(s, a) \).

### **D3QN Agent**

The `D3QN_agent` class orchestrates the training process. Key components include:
- **Epsilon-Greedy Action Selection**: Chooses actions based on Q-values with exploration controlled by epsilon.
- **Learning**: Updates the Q-values using the Double DQN method and the dueling architecture.
- **Target Network**: Soft updates ensure that the target network slowly tracks the main network, improving stability.

---

## **4 - Training and Evaluation**

### **Training Process**

The agent interacts with the environment, collects experiences, and updates its Q-network using mini-batches sampled from the replay memory. The key hyperparameters include:
- **Learning rate**: Controls the step size during learning.
- **Discount factor**: Determines the importance of future rewards.
- **Epsilon decay**: Reduces exploration over time as the agent learns.



### **Performance Analysis**

The performance of the agent is evaluated based on:
- **Reward accumulation**: Tracks the total reward obtained by the agent over episodes.
- **Q-value estimation**: Measures the average Q-values across states.
- **Loss reduction**: Observes how the loss decreases as the agent learns.

### **Visualization**

Multiple plots help visualize the training process:
- **Reward Plot**: Shows the reward progression over episodes.
- **Loss Plot**: Tracks how the model loss changes during training.
- **Mean Q-Value Plot**: Visualizes the mean Q-value estimates.
- **Epsilon Decay Plot**: Illustrates how exploration decreases over time.

## **5 - Results**

The D3QN agent demonstrates significant improvement in landing success as training progresses. Here are the agentâ€™s performances across different training epochs:

  <tr>
    <td>Epoch 10<br><img src="assets/10epoch.gif" alt="Epoch 10 Performance" width="240px"></td>
    <td>Epoch 750<br><img src="assets/750epoch.gif" alt="Epoch 750 Performance" width="240px"></td>
    <td>Epoch 1500<br><img src="assets/1500epoch.gif" alt="Epoch 1500 Performance" width="240px"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The training results reveal that the D3QN agent progressively learns more effective landing strategies, particularly after fine-tuning hyperparameters such as epsilon decay and learning rate.

## **6 - Future Directions**

In future work, we aim to extend this project by exploring:
- **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Implementing a more sophisticated experience replay strategy where experiences with higher TD errors are replayed more often.
- **Noisy Networks for Exploration**: Replacing epsilon-greedy exploration with parameter-based exploration techniques.
- **Comparison with Other Algorithms**: Evaluating the performance of D3QN against other advanced RL algorithms such as **Rainbow DQN** and **Actor-Critic methods**.
